                 <h4 id="story">The story so far</h4>
                 <p><span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> has formally started in 2010 as a one-year project funded by <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/inf11/jiscexpo/jiscopencitation.aspx">JISC</a> (with a subsequent extension), with David Shotton as director, who at that time was working in the <a href="https://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Zoology</a> at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>. The project was global in scope, and was designed to change the face of scientific publishing and scholarly communication, since it aimed to publish open bibliographic citation information in RDF and to make citation links as easy to traverse as Web links. The main deliverable of the project, among <a href="https://opencitations.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/jisc-open-citations-project-–-final-project-blog-post/">several outcomes</a>, was the release of an open repository of scholarly citation data described using the <a href="http://www.sparontologies.net/">SPAR (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) Ontologies</a>, and named the <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> Corpus (OCC), which was initially populated with the citations from journal articles within the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/">Open Access Subset of PubMed Central</a>.</p>

                 <p>At the end of 2015, after David Shotton had become a member of the <a href="http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk">Oxford e-Research Centre</a> at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>, Silvio Peroni of the <a href="http://www.unibo.it">University of Bologna</a> joined <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> as co-director and technical manager, with the aim of setting up a new instantiation of the Corpus based on a new metadata schema and employing several new technologies to automate the ingestion of fresh citation metadata from authoritative sources. Silvio Peroni is now a member of the <a href="http://www.ficlit.unibo.it">Department of Classic Philology and Italian Studies</a> at the University of Bologna, and the current instantiation of the OCC is hosted by the <a href="http://www.informatica.unibo.it">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at the University of Bologna. Since the beginning of July 2016 OCC has been ingesting, processing and publishing reference lists of scholarly papers available in <a href="http://europepmc.org/">Europe PubMed Central</a>. Additional metadata for these citations are obtained from <a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a> and (for authors) <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>.</p>

                <p>In 2017, <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> was awarded of a grant from the <a href="https://sloan.org">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a> for <a href="https://sloan.org/grant-detail/8017">The OpenCitations Enhancement Project</a>. The funding <a href="https://opencitations.wordpress.com/2019/01/02/opencitations-enhancement-project-final-report/">was used</a> to improve the hardware and software infrastructure for handling the data and hosting all the services <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> makes available. During this period, <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> has developed a number of <a href="/index">citation indexes</a> using the data openly available in third-party bibliographic databases. The first and largest of these is <a href="/index/coci">COCI, the OpenCitations Index of Crossref open DOI-to-DOI citations</a>.</p>

                <p>In 2019, <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> wa awarded of another grant from the <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a> for the <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/people-and-projects/grants-awarded/open-biomedical-citations-context-corpus">Open Biomedical Citations in Context Corpus project</a>. The <a href="https://opencitations.wordpress.com/2018/12/23/the-wellcome-trust-funds-opencitations/">aim</a> of this project is to create a new dataset containing data for each individual in-text reference, making it possible to distinguish references that are cited only once from those that are cited multiple times, to see which references are cited together (e.g. in the same sentence), to determine in which section of the article references are cited (e.g. Introduction, Methods), and, potentially, to retrieve the function of the citation.</p>

                <p>Recently, at the end of 2019, <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> has been selected by the <a href="https://scoss.org/">Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services (SCOSS)</a> for their second round of crowd-funding support. They stated that <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> aligns well with open science goals and is an innovative service - considering that open citation data are important to the community since they have the potential to support change in research assessment, and if successful could be a game changer by challenging established proprietary citation services. Starting in January 2020, <a href="https://scoss.org/">SCOSS</a> will invite research organizations, scholarly institutions and funders of all sizes throughout the world to contribute financially in proportion to their size and ability to sustain <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span>' operations over the next three years as it transitions into a global scholarly infrastructure organization with a secure financial footing.</p>

                <p><span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> is currently managed by the <a href="https://openscholarlymetadata.org">Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata</a>, an independent research centre within the <a href="https://www.unibo.it/en">University of Bologna</a>. The Research Centre has an International Board drawn from leaders within the main bibliographic stakeholder communities of relevance (librarians, bibliometricians, academics, data service providers, etc.) who have shown past solid commitment to open scholarship. The statutes of the Research Centre will ensure that <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span>' original aim of free provision of open bibliographic and citation data, services and software is maintained, and that <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> as an organization cannot in future be taken over or controlled by commercial interests, nor become involved in political, regulatory, legislative or financial lobbying of any kind.</p>
