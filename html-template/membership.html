                <p>By supporting <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span>, you will help us to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Increase the number of open bibliographic metadata and citation data available;</p></li>
                    <li><p>Improve our software and hardware infrastructure to provide better services;</p></li>
                    <li><p>Engage with new partners interested in using and sharing open citation data.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h4 id="why">Why support <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span>?</h4>

                <p><span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> is an independent infrastructure organisation for open scholarship dedicated to the publication of open bibliographic and citation data. It also provides open source software and free services for use by the global academic community and the general public, and is engaged in advocacy for open citations and open scholarly metadata, particularly in its role as a key founding member of the <a href="https://i4oc.org">Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC)</a>, and the <a href="https://i4oa.org">Initiative for Open Abstracts (I4OA).</a></p>

                <p>At the end of 2019, the <a href="https://scoss.org">Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services (SCOSS)</a>, which facilitates funding to help ensure the sustainability of the world’s Open Science infrastructure, has selected <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span>, together with two other open infrastructure services, as worthy of community crowdfunding support in its three-year-long second funding cycle. In evaluating <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span> among all the applicants, the SCOSS Board concluded that <span class="oc-purple">Open</span><span class="oc-blue">Citations</span>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>aligns well with open science goals;</p></li>
                    <li><p>provides an innovative service of open citation data;</p></li>
                    <li><p>could be a game changer, challenging established proprietary citation services;</p></li>
                    <li><p>supports change in research assessment;</p></li>
                    <li><p>is infrastructure at risk and in need of financial sustainability.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>At the end of 2021, OpenCitations received the Open Publishing Award in Open Data as an infrastructure that perfectly represents the open principles. The jury panel stated that "it is clear that OpenCitations is one of the fundamental projects in open publishing, specifically in open scientific publishing".</p>
